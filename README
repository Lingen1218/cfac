FAC is a software package for the calculation of various atomic processes,
written by Ming Feng Gu at the Space Science Laboratory of Berkeley.

The last official version of FAC is 1.1.1 (released in 2006). cFAC was started
as a maintenance project due to a lack of interest from the original author in
the last years. The main focus is on providing large volumes of data as
required, e.g., for collisional-radiative plasma modeling. See ChangeLog for
details. The original file, documenting development up to the version 1.1.1, is
kept as doc/ChangeLog.MFG.

There has never been an explicit statement about either copyright or licensing
of FAC. Some bits of the FAC sources, which are still used in cFAC, bear
copyright notices by NAG. On the other hand, cFAC heavily relies on the GNU
Scientific Library (GSL), released under the GPL terms. AS A RESULT, THE
COMBINED SOFTWARE IS NOT DISTRIBUTABLE. A future release may have these issues
fixed.


Prerequisites:
1) The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>,
   version 1.15 or above (earlier versions will NOT work).
2) The SQLite software library <http://www.sqlite.org/>.

Note: If you install the above software using a package manager of your OS, make
      sure you select the development packages (*-dev*).

Installation:
1) ./configure
Note 1: Specify --prefix=my/dir, if the default /usr/local is not what you 
        want. This directory only affects the installation of the sfac
        executable.
Note 2: Use the "--with-extrainc" and "--with-extralib" options if the
        third-party libraries are not installed in the default system place.
Note 3: Run ./configure --help for more options.

2) make

3) make check
This will run a test suite of demo scripts. Any error should be reported!

4) make install
This installs the "sfac" binary.

Usage:
The "sfac" executable accepts an input file as its only argument. See the demo
directory for examples. For more details, please read the manual, and be sure to
read the FAQ section of it.
