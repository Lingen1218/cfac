CFACDB is a set of application programming interface (API) calls for accessing
cFAC-generated databases from C or Fortran codes.

cFAC is a descendant of Flexible Atomic Code (FAC), a software package for
calculation of atomic structure and various processes, written by Ming Feng Gu
at the Space Science Laboratory of Berkeley. The main focus of cFAC is on
producing large volumes of data as required, e.g., for collisional-radiative
plasma modeling.

The data are returned via user-provided "sink" callback routines.

Prerequisites:
-------------
1) C and Fortran compilers (gcc and gfortran recommended);
2) standard Unix set of utilities (make, sed, cat, sh,...)
3) The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>;
4) The SQLite software library <http://www.sqlite.org/>.

Note: If you install the above libraries using a package manager of your OS,
      make sure you select the development packages (*-dev*).

Installation:
------------
1) Edit Make.conf according to your preferences
2) make
3) make install

If successful, the library and the C header file will be installed. In addition,
the (very rudimentary at the moment) "cfacdbu" utility will be installed.
When run with a database pathname as its argument, a basic information of the
data stored in the file will be displayed. The functionality of the utility will
soon be extended.

Usage:
-----
Until a proper documentation is written, please refer to the "fdemo.f" Fortran
code demonstrating usage of the Fortran API.
