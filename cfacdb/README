CFACDB is a set of application programming interface (API) calls for accessing
cFAC-generated databases from C or Fortran codes.

The data are returned via user-provided "sink" callback routines. Until a proper
documentation is written, please refer to the "fdemo.f" Fortran code
demonstrating usage of the Fortran API.

In addition, a very rudimentary at the moment "cfacdbu" utility is provided.
When run with a database pathname as its argument, a basic information of the
data stored in the file will be displayed. The functionality of the utility will
soon be extended.
